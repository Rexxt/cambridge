Playing the game
----------------

### Windows

You do not need LÖVE on Windows, as it comes bundled with the program.  

#### Stable release

To get the stable release, simply download either `cambridge-win32.zip` (32-bit) or `cambridge-windows.zip` (64-bit) in the [latest release](https://github.com/sashlilac/cambridge/releases/latest).  

All assets needed are bundled with the executable.

#### Bleeding edge

If you want the bleeding edge version, download [this](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/archive/master.zip).

Extract the ZIP, open a Command Prompt at the folder you extracted Cambridge to, then run this command:

	dist\windows\love.exe .

Alternatively, if you're on a 32-bit system, run this instead:

	dist\win32\love.exe .

32-bit systems do not support rich presence integration.

Then, check the mod pack section at the bottom of this page.

### macOS, Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're using LÖVE 11, because it won't work with earlier versions!**

#### Downloading a release

You can download the .love file in the latest release, and run it with:

    love cambridge.love

#### Installing from source

Clone the repository in git:

	git clone https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge

Alternatively, download the source code ZIP in the latest release.

Then, navigate to the root directory that you just cloned, and type:

	love .

It should run automatically!
